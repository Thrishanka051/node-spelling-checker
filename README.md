# Spelling Checker in Typescript

This spelling checker will allow you to quickly validate your custom text input by just inserting it in the browser page. The usage of Trie data structure on back-end allows for a fast word-lookup, which makes the process of both adding custom dictionaries and validating text superfast. 

The default dictionary comes with all English words in it. You can overwrite it to check some other language.
